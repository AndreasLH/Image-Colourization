# Image-Colourization
Image colourization for our project in the DTU Deep Learning course (02456)

# Milestones
- [x] Data: use the places365 dataset (remove BW images)
- [x] Make the baseline (GAN and L1-loss without transfer learning)
- [] Test difference between L1 and L2 loss on baseline model
- [] Use image labels as additional conditional data and assess improvement
- [] Evaluate how image label data improved the model â€¢ Use different backbones (encoder [cnn])
- [] 2 backbones VGG19, Xception
- [x] Quantitative evaluation (colourfulness, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR))
- [] Qualitative human evaluation (by us) on 5 images each (discussion in report)
- [] Final run with best model compared to baseline
